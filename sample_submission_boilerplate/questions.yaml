task: >
  You are given a 10x Genomics Visium filtered count matrix (HDF5).
  Reproduce a minimal CRC Visium analysis and answer the following,
  using only this H5 as input.

questions:
  - id: q1
    stage: h5_validation
    text: "How many features (genes) are recorded in the H5 matrix?"
    answer_type: integer_exact

  - id: q2
    stage: gene_summary
    text: "How many genes have nonzero counts in at least one spot?"
    answer_type: integer_exact

  - id: q3
    stage: spot_metrics
    text: "What is the median number of detected genes per spot?"
    answer_type: integer_exact

  - id: q4
    stage: expression_ranking
    text: "Provide the top 5 genes ranked by total counts across all spots (highestâ†’lowest)."
    answer_type: ordered_list

  - id: q5
    stage: marker_enrichment
    text: "Which CMS-associated epithelial marker set is enriched in the top-expressed spot cluster (one of {CMS1_like, CMS2_like, CMS3_like, CMS4_like})?"
    answer_type: string_exact
